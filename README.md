With the complete HTML I was able to have a succedful layout of the page for the user to start the quiz, but overall I did not have a complete page for the game. 
The JavaScript was not completed on time for the deadline. 
I still needed to show some of the other question that I set up for in the object. 
I also still needed to have a scoreboard for the user to sumbit their initials for the browswer to remember the score and the name. 
The timer for the game was also completed. 
I will have to go back at a later time and add all of the JavaScript and make it a complete project.
